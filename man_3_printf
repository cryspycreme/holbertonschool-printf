.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a custom implementation of the standard
.Xr printf
function in C.
It writes output to the standard output stream based on a format string and a variable number of arguments.
The following format specifiers are supported:
.Bl -tag -width ".It %x"
.It %c
Prints a single character.
.It %s
Prints a string.
.It %d
Prints a signed decimal integer.
.It %i
Prints a signed decimal integer.
.It %%
Prints a literal percent sign.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following examples demonstrate usage of
.B _printf
with various format specifiers:

.TP
.B _printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\\n");
Prints the sentence: "Let's try to printf a simple sentence."

.TP
.B _printf("Length:[%d, %i]\\n", 10, 10);
Prints the length twice: "Length:[10, 10]"

.TP
.B _printf("Negative:[%d]\\n", -762534);
Prints a negative signed integer: "Negative:[-762534]"

.TP
.B _printf("Character:[%c]\\n", 'H');
Prints a single character: "Character:[H]"

.TP
.B _printf("String:[%s]\\n", "I am a string !");
Prints a string: "String:[I am a string !]"

.TP
.B _printf("Percent:[%%]\\n");
Prints a literal percent sign: "Percent:[%]"

.It
Does not handle field width (e.g., %5d)
.It
Does not handle precision (e.g., %.2f)
.It
Does not handle length modifiers (e.g., %ld, %hhx)
.El
